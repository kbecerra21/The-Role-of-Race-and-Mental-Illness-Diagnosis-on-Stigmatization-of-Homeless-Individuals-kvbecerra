  abstract = {Summary: Previous research has shown that people labeled with drug addiction are viewed as more blameworthy and dangerous compared to individuals labeled with mental illness who, in turn, are viewed more harshly than those with physical disabilities. Endorsement of such stereotypes often lead to less helping behavior and more avoidance of people with drug addiction compared to those with mental illness. In this study, attribution and dangerousness models are tested on a stratified random sample of the US population. The sample was recruited from a national online research panel (N = 815). Research participants read a vignette about a person with one of the three health conditions (mental illness, drug addiction, or physically handicapped in a wheelchair) and were asked to complete items representing attribution and dangerousness judgments about the person. {$\bullet$} Findings: Results are consistent with our hypotheses. Addicted to drugs was seen as more blameworthy and dangerous compared to mental illness. {$\bullet$} Applications: These findings are important for framing the stigma and stereotypes of mental illness and drug addiction are discussed. In turn, these kinds of basic models will inform stigma change efforts of advocates.},

  abstract = {Males and black persons are overrepresented among the homeless population and experience differential trajectories in homelessness and access to services. However, research has not fully examined the extent to which the race and sex of homeless persons affect stigmatizing responses toward them. Drawing on stigma and attribution theories and using data from experimental vignettes administered to a sample of public university students (n = 195), we examine the effects of the race and gender of homeless persons on perceptions of blameworthiness, dangerousness, and social distance. We find that black and male homeless persons are perceived as more dangerous, but not more blameworthy. Both perceived dangerousness and blameworthiness are associated with increased desired social distance. Also, we find that subjects who are more politically conservative desire greater social distance from homeless persons because they consider them more blameworthy and more dangerous.},
