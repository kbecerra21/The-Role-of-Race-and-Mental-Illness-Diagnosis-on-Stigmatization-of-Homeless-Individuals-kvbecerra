# The-Role-of-Race-and-Mental-Illness-Diagnosis-on-Stigmatization-of-Homeless-Individuals-kvbecerra

This repository contains an R project focused on exploring the stigmatization of homeless individuals, with a particular emphasis on how race and mental illness diagnosis influence this process.
# Research Question
How do race and mental illness diagnosis impact the stigmatization of homeless individuals?
# Purpose for this Repository
This Project will be use to write up the results of a project that I conducted in my undergraduate institution with the purpose of formulating it into an APA paper that will be sent to Undergraduate professor Dr. Lisa Hayes. Dr. Hayes is planning to us this paper to remind her self of the results as the next face of the project is to look at how participant demographics affected the results. I have included the possible analyis in the qmd found in the data folder.

Data_Cleaning_2.Rmd: The second round of data cleaning, which results in the final_cleaned_data.csv file.

DATA_Cleaning_and_objectives.qmd: Is the file that has the most code and the place where most of the objectives were meet. This file has data cleaning, plotting and additional test that go along with the other hypothesis for this paper that I could not refine  quick enough to include in the qmd.
