abstract: "Homelessness in the United States is a persistent problem that can have serious implications on the well-being of homeless individuals. The present study focused on the role of race and mental illness diagnosis on the stigmatization of homeless individuals, specifically looking at the outcomes of the Attribution Questionnaire. This questionnaire assessed the aspects of social distance, blame, dangerousness, concern, and willingness to help of 215 participants varying in ages across adulthood. The study was a self-paced online form that used six experimental vignettes. The results indicated that there were no significant interactions of race x diagnosis on stigmatization. Additionally, race had no significant main effects, suggesting it was not a significant factor for stigmatization of homeless individuals. However, there were some significant main effects of diagnosis. Findings might suggest that future work in reducing mental illness stigma and increasing education could help decrease stigmatization of the homeless population."

Homelessness in the United States and the struggle to give individuals adequate housing is a persistent problem. Before the Covid -19 pandemic, the number of homeless individuals was on the rise with 568,000 individuals experiencing homelessness in 2019, an increase of 15,000 from the previous year[@frostHomelessnessWasRise2020]. With the current Covid-19 pandemic, we can only predict that those numbers have continued to increase. In the United States, 2.4% of homeless individuals die each year (Stasha, 2020). We know that the general population often tries to distance itself from the stigmatized population, more specifically the homeless population. Homeless individuals face greater stigma and social isolation and often are removed from public parks and other locations because the general public does not want them too close. The problems caused by stigmatization, such as social distancing, can affect the homeless population in terms of resources that they have available such as sanitation centers, employment, and social support. Often the homeless population lacks resources and is exposed to the elements which can increase their mortality, as well as the chance of being malnourished, having parasitic infestations, periodontal disease, degenerative joint diseases, venereal diseases, cirrhosis, and hepatitis-related to intravenous (IV) drug abuse. Public attitudes toward homeless individuals can influence policies and the services provided to this population. The attitudes displayed through the stigma of homeless individuals can have an impact on both physical and psychological health and willingness to access services. The impact of these stigmas has shown to have serious implications on the well-being of homeless individuals. The present study examined factors that could predict levels of stigmatization expressed towards homeless individuals. 

## Literature review 
>Research on the stigma of mental illness, homelessness, and race highlights its harmful effects on health and social integration. @corriganPublicStigmaMental2009 examined public stigma, focusing on stereotypes like causal attribution (blaming individuals for their condition) and dangerousness (perceiving them as threatening). Using vignette-based experiments, the study found that people with psychiatric disorders, especially those with drug addiction, faced greater stigma than those with physical disabilities, laying the foundation for understanding how schizophrenia and substance use disorders contribute to homelessness stigma.
>
>While @corriganAttributionModelPublic2003 explored mental illness stigma, it did not examine health outcomes. In contrast, @weiszStigmatizedIdentitiesPsychological2018 demonstrated that homelessness stigma leads to psychological distress, poor health, and social avoidance. Among 175 volunteers at a homeless event, those experiencing or anticipating stigma reported worse physical and mental health and greater reluctance to seek services. Participants of color faced even higher distress and service avoidance, highlighting the compounded impact of race and homelessness stigma.
>
>Building on this, @markowitzRaceGenderHomelessness2021 investigated race and gender intersections in stigma. They found that black homeless individuals were perceived as more dangerous than white counterparts, though no significant differences in social distance emerged. However, the study's reliance on college-aged participants, who may have been more tolerant than the general population, was a limitation. The present study addresses this by including a broader, more diverse sample.
>
>Similarly, @gattisPerceivedRacialSexual2016 linked racial stigma and discrimination to heightened depression among 89 black adolescents and young adults experiencing homelessness. Using social and minority stress models, the study highlighted how marginalized groups face greater psychological distress due to limited societal support. Though constrained by a small sample, it reinforced the role of racial stigma in homelessness experiences.
>
>In sum, stigma related to homelessness, mental illness, and race profoundly affects psychological and physical health, social integration, and resource access. The present study expands on this research by examining how mental illness and race interact to shape stigma, offering a more nuanced understanding of its impact on homeless individuals

## Current Study
>Building on the research by @corriganPublicStigmaMental2009, @markowitzRaceGenderHomelessness2021, and @weiszStigmatizedIdentitiesPsychological2018 the current study aimed to explore how race and mental illness diagnosis impact the stigmatization of homeless individuals. The research specifically focused on mental illness, distinguishing between individuals with schizophrenia and those with substance use disorders, and examined how these factors interact with race in shaping stigma. Previous studies suggest that public stigma varies across mental health conditions and that race plays a crucial role in determining the intensity of stigma. Based on these findings, the present study hypothesized that race would significantly influence social distance, perceived danger, blameworthiness, and emotional responses (concern and help) toward homeless individuals. Specifically, it was predicted that black homeless individuals would experience greater social distance, be perceived as more dangerous and more blameworthy, and receive less concern and help compared to their white counterparts. Additionally, it was anticipated that individuals with substance use disorders would face higher levels of social distance, dangerousness, and blame, while individuals with schizophrenia would receive more concern and help. Lastly, the study predicted that race and mental illness diagnosis would interact to influence all aspects of stigmatization.

### Hypotheses 
#### Effect of Race on Stigmatization
> 1. Black homeless individuals will experience greater social distance.
> 2. Black homeless individuals will be perceived as more dangerous.
> 3. Black homeless individuals will be perceived as more blameworthy.
> 4. Black homeless individuals will receive less concern and help compared to white homeless individuals.

#### Effect of Mental Illness Diagnosis on Stigmatization

> 1. Individuals with substance use disorders will face higher levels of social distance.
> 2. Individuals with substance use disorders will be perceived as more dangerous.
> 3. Individuals with substance use disorders will be perceived as more blameworthy.
> 4. Individuals with schizophrenia will receive more concern and help.
> 5. Interaction Between Race and Mental Illness Diagnosis

#### Race and mental illness diagnosis interaction
> 1. Race and mental Illness diagnosis will interact to influence all aspects of stigmatization, including social distance, perceived danger, blameworthiness, concern, and willingness to help.
